We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and expression.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Helping others learn and grow
- Sharing knowledge generously
- Celebrating contributions from others

### Unacceptable Behavior

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, please contact us at conduct@openshop.com. All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

### Investigation Process

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated by the community leaders and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

### Consequences

Community leaders may choose to take any of the following actions, in order of severity:

1. **Warning**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.
2. **Temporary Ban**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.
3. **Permanent Ban**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
